# HomeTonight Vertx Tutorial

Hello again! I decided to start [a new tutorial](https://www.mednikov.net/category/home-tonight/), devoted to the Vert.x framework. This time, we would build a full-stack web application, based on the immortal MVC pattern, using Vert.x and Java, and MongoDB as a data storage. Also we would put a bit of Vue.js in front-end portion of our app for dynamic rendering. Ready? Let start!
